# Introduction
A list of helpful resources for general productivity, programming, and random things.



# Personal

ðŸŽž My background is in TV and Film production. I love a good movie. ðŸ¤“ I love finding solutions to problems. If I'm not programming you can find me skiing â›·â›° or trying my hand at home renovation.

My goal is to work on great projects with great people. Passionate about creating easy to use products that save people time. I pride myself on my ability to rapidly try out new ideas, and develop corresponding product pipelines.

# Work

I work for a non-profit called [ACP Decisions](https://acpdecisions.org) that specializes in Healthcare Education. We have [a large library of videos and guides](https://acpdecisions.org/library/) (250+) in over 20 languages. Some of the largest healthcare networks take utilize this content to ensure that patients are empowered with essential information to make informed medical decisions.

As Chief Information Officer at ACP Decisions, I am responsible for:

- Developing our long term technical strategy.
- Ensuring the security and integrity of our systems and products.
- Managing the product development of our web and API web services collectively called [My ACP Decisions](https://my.acpdecisions.org/#!/login) used by thousands of clinicians and patients.
- Developing and maintaining [ACP Tools](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/acp-tools/id777516324?mt=8) our iOS App.
- Supporting customers via our [Help Desk](https://docs.app.acpdecisions.org).
- Writing our [user guides and support documentation](https://docs.app.acpdecisions.org).
- Maintaining [our company website](https://acpdecisions.org).
- Creating internal tools to maximize the effectiveness of a very small team:
  - A Mac and iOS client that automates over 130 time consuming and repetitive tasks.
  - Tableau dashboards for key stakeholders and prototyping new reporting.
  - Bash scripts for maintaining workstations and servers.
  - Master slide decks for specific marketing and sales scenarios.
  - Developing documentation templates for repetitive inquiries and FAQs.
  - A Mac helper app that drafts monthly release notes.
  - An automated internal documentation website for all company polices, marketing, and sales materials.
